# MBHC-FMM
This reposity provides MATLAB implementation of: Model-based hierarchical clustering with Bregman divergences and Fishers mixture model (MBHC-FMM).

- It performs clustering on the 3D directional data using the MBHC-FMM method. It has been applied to cluster image normals (3D unit vectors) to analyze depth image.

- There are three demo files to demonstrate the above mentioned tasks.

Note: Four files: emsamp.m, vsamp.m, unitrand.m and house.m are added here for sampling observations from a specified vMF mixture model. Those files are taken from 'vmfmatlab' code, which is available online.
