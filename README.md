# MBHC-FMM
This reposity provides MATLAB implementation of: Model-based hierarchical clustering with Bregman divergences and Fishers mixture model (MBHC-FMM).
It performs clustering on the 3D directional data using the MBHC-FMM method. It has been applied to cluster image normals (3D unit vectors) to analyze depth image.
There are three demo files to demonstrate the above mentioned tasks.
